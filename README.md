        <h1>Vincent Ash</h1>
        <h2>Sophomore in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>My name is Vincent, and I am a sophomore at Bob Jones University, majoring in Business Administration with a concentration in finance. I am in the Phi Kappa Pi Rams Society here at Bob Jones. </p>

            I am part of Morningside Baptist Church. My favorite website is    
            <a href="https://www.marshallstreetdiscgolf.com/">Marshallstreet.com</a>, and you can email me

         <p>
           I enjoy watching college basketball, listening to '90s rock, and having meaningful conversations. I also enjoy playing sports; I especially love disc golf, basketball, and volleyball. Other things I enjoy are writing poetry, sleeping in, watching anime, playing RPGs, and dabbling in digital art (at the bottom of the page is my first piece of digital artwork).

        <h3>PERSONALITY</h3>
        I’m the type of person who hates small talk but also doesn’t have the social skills to start conversations of any importance with new people.  The culture of relationships being like a game where if you make a wrong decision, you get the bad ending like in an RPG, gets on my nerves. I like to think I’m funny, I’m undoubtedly awkward, and I genuinely care about people.<br />
